# Basic Photo Editor
## Python
This is a program I made back in 2016 that has not been updated since - it 
lets you open a picture, rotate it how you want, and rename it to something 
more accurate. In the future some planned updates are being able to add text 
to the image, and cleaning up the code because it's not easy to read currently.
